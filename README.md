# Home Energy Score (PNNL)

Welcome to PNNL's project stack for the Home Energy Scoring Tool application

Your gateway to Dockerizing the app and beginning local development is through the `hes-devvm` project, which offers instructions and scripts to clone the main repositories and build the docker images/containers.  You will find other development scripts and tools for HES in `hes-dev-tool`
